# Responsive-Assignment1-ProgrammingHero

Redoing the Assignment 1 of ProgrammingHero, but this time I am making it responsive! 

Did not attempt to use animations as decided earlier, since I do not think it is worth. Will practice animation in a better project.
Also used only one breakpoint, kept it responsive with as little effort as possible.

Furthermore, the decision was based on me doing the Kevil Powell's 21 days layout challenge, where I will learn better ways to make layouts responsive. Therefore, I am abandoning this.
